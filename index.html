			<h5>Ogilvy & Mather</h5>
			<p>
I started my professional career at Ogilvy & Mather. It was a fantastic opportunity. I learned what it takes to be one of the largest and most respected Advertising Agencies in the world. During my time there I became interested in 3D and pushing my skills and knowledge further.

			<h2>Gnomon</h2>
			<p>Then I attend courses at The Gnomon School of Visual Effects where I completed intensive drawing and design training. Each class increased my knowledge, technique, and understanding of the creative process. I specialized in particle effects and fluid dynamics. I continued my education by taking workshops offered at Side Effects Software, the creators of Houdini. There I learned directly from the programmers and designers of Houdini. I worked on a movie called "The Employer" (2013). I was responsible for the visual effects. The movie went on to receive 13 awards.

			<h2>Tangerine Talent</h2>
			<p>A close friend approached me about being involved in a talent agency. Having just completed a long track in visual effects I was hesitant to change paths. I remembered back to working at Ogilvy and Mather and how exciting and interesting it had been. I decided to make the change and start the talent agency. We started with under 10 clients and few insider connections to the entertainment industry. We went on to represent over 300 clients and work with over 100 different casting directors and book 200 commercials in under three years. During this time I met with 600+ actors and talent.

			<h2>App Development</h2>
			<p>I once again have decided to keep pushing myself and continue to learn. I have enrolled in two classes at General Assembly. One focused on getting up to date with current UX trends and the other to learn the fundamentals of Swift to program iphone/ipad apps. I have two apps underway and I am looking for other projects to get involved in.
